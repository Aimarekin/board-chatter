This means you can grab Board Chatter, put your favourite sauce on it and release it as a new recipe, but you must credit the developer of Board Chatter ([@Aimarekin](https://glitch.com/@Aimarekin)) and link the original project of [Board Chatter](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/board-chatter?path=README.md). You can't sell your recipe either.
